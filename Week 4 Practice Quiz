1.Question 1
Heights of 10 year-olds, regardless of gender,  closely follow a normal distribution with mean 55 inches and standard deviation 6 inches. 
Which of the following is true?
    A normal probability plot of heights of a random sample of 500 10 year- olds people should show a fairly straight line.

2.Question 2
While it is often assumed that the probabilities of having a boy or a girl are the same, the actual probability of having a boy is 
slightly higher at 0.51. Suppose a couple plans to have 3 children. What is the probability that exactly 2 of them will be boys?
    0.38

3.Question 3
You are about to take a multi-day tour through a national park which is famous for its wildlife. 
The tour guide tells you that on any given day there’s a 61% chance that a visitor will see at least one “big game” animal, 
and a 39% chance they’ll see no big game animals; when the tour guide says “big game”, he refers to either a moose or a bear. 
The guide assures you that big game sightings on a single day are independent of any other day’s sightings. 
Given the information from the tour guide, which of the following calculations cannot be performed using a binomial distribution?
    Calculate the probability that you see at least 4 big game animals on the first day of a 5-day trip.

4.Question 4
Your friend is about to begin an introductory chemistry course at his university. The course has collected data from students on their study 
habits for many years, and the professor reports that study times (in hours) for the final exam closely follow a normal distribution 
with mean 24 and standard deviation 4. What percentage of students study 34 hours or more?
    less than 2.5%

5.Question 5
Which of the following is false? Hint: It might be useful to sketch the distributions.
    --Z scores are defined for observations from distributions of any shape and skew.
    --Calculating percentiles based on the Z table is only appropriate for observations that come from (nearly) normal distributions.

6.Question 6
About 30% of human twins are identical, and the rest are fraternal. Identical twins are necessarily the same sex, 
half are males and the other half are females. One-quarter of fraternal twins are both male, one-quarter both female, 
and one-half are mixes: one male, one female. You have just become a parent of twins and are told they are both girls. 
Given this information, what is the probability that they are identical?
    46

7.Question 7
Which of the following probabilities can be calculated using the normal approximation to the binomial distribution?
    A clothing store offers store credit cards and only about 17% of the credit card holders are males. If we were to randomly sample 100 store credit card holders to conduct a survey, what is the probability that at most 20 of the sampled individuals would be males?

1.Question 1
Suppose IQ scores are normally distributed with mean 100 and standard deviation 10. Which of the following is false?
    --A normal probability plot of IQ scores of a random sample of 1,000 people should show a straight line.
    --A score greater than 130 is more unusual than a score less than 80.
    --Roughly 68% of people have IQ scores between 90 and 110.

2.Question 2
A 2005 survey found that 7% of teenagers (ages 13 to 17) suffer from an extreme fear of spiders (arachnophobia). At a summer camp there 
are 10 teenagers sleeping in each tent. Assume that these 10 teenagers are independent of each other. What is the probability that at 
least one of them suffers from arachnophobia?
    52%

3.Question 3
Your roommate loves to eat Chinese food for dinner. He estimates that on any given night, there’s a 30% chance he’ll choose to eat 
Chinese food. Although he loves Chinese food, he doesn’t like to eat it too much in a short period of time, so on most weeks he eats 
several different kinds of foods for dinner. Suppose you wanted to calculate the probability that, over the next 7 days, you friend 
eats Chinese food at least 3 times. Which of the following is the most accurate statement about calculating this probability?
    Because he doesn’t like to eat Chinese food too much in a short period of time, p is not really the same for each trial and so we cannot use the binomial distribution to calculate the desired probability.

4.Question 4
Suppose you observe a data point x = 12 and it is known that this data point came from a normal distribution with mean 5 and standard 
deviation 2. Which of the following statements is true regarding the observation of x = 12?
    The observation would be considered unusual because it is farther than three standard deviations from the mean.

5.Question 5
Which of the following is true? Hint: It might be useful to sketch the distributions.
    The Z score for the median is approximately 0 if the distribution is bimodal and symmetric.

6.Question 6
More than three-quarters of the nation’s colleges and universities now offer online classes, and about 23% of college graduates have 
taken a course online. 39% of those who have taken a course online believe that online courses provide the same educational value as 
one taken in person, a view shared by only 27% of those who have not taken an online course. At a coffee shop you overhear a recent 
college graduate discussing that she doesn’t believe that online courses provide the same educational value as one taken in person. 
What’s the probability that she has taken an online course before?
    0.1997

7.Question 7
Your boss is a biologist who needs wood samples from long-leaf pine trees with a fungal disease which is only visible under a 
microscope, and she sends you on an assignment to collect the samples. She wants at least 50 different diseased samples. 
She tells you that approximately 28% of long-leaf pine trees currently have the fungal disease. If you sample 160 long-leaf pine 
trees at random, what is the probability you’ll have at least 50 diseased samples to return to your boss? (Use the normal approximation 
to calculate this probability and chose the closest answer to the question.)
    18%

8. About 24% of flights departing from New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport were delayed in 2009. Assuming that the chance of a flight being delayed has stayed constant at 24%, we are interested in finding the probability of 10 out of the next 100 departing flights being delayed. Noting that if one flight is delayed, the next flight is more likely to be delayed, which of the following statements is correct?
    We cannot calculate this probability using the binomial distribution since whether or not one flight is delayed is not independent of another.
