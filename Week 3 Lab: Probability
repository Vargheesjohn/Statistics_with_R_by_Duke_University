Simulation
```{r head-tail}
coin_outcomes <- c("heads", "tails")
sample(coin_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```

Run the second command listed above several times. Just like when flipping a coin, sometimes you'll get a heads, 
sometimes you'll get a tails, but in the long run, you'd expect to get roughly equal numbers of each.
If you wanted to simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times, you could either run the function 100 times or, more simply, 
adjust the `size` argument, which governs how many samples to draw 
(the `replace = TRUE` argument indicates we put the slip of paper back in the hat before drawing again). 
Save the resulting vector of heads and tails in a new object called `sim_fair_coin`.
```{r sim-fair-coin}
sim_fair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE)
```

To view the results of this simulation, type the name of the object and then use `table` to count up the number of heads and tails.
```{r table-sim-fair-coin}
sim_fair_coin
table(sim_fair_coin)
```

Since there are only two elements in `outcomes`, the probability that we "flip" a coin and it lands heads is 0.5. 
Say we're trying to simulate an unfair coin that we know only lands heads 20% of the time. We can adjust for this 
by adding an argument called `prob`, which provides a vector of two probability weights.
```{r sim-unfair-coin}
sim_unfair_coin <- sample(coin_outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, 
                          prob = c(0.2, 0.8))
```
`prob = c(0.2, 0.8)` indicates that for the two elements in the `outcomes` vector, we want to select the first one, `heads`, 
with probability 0.2 and the second one, `tails` with probability 0.8. Another way of thinking about this is to think of 
the outcome space as a bag of 10 chips, where 2 chips are labeled "head" and 8 chips "tail". 
Therefore at each draw, the probability of drawing a chip that says "head"" is 20%, and "tail" is 80%.

## Simulating the Independent Shooter
Simulating a basketball player who has independent shots uses the same mechanism that we use to simulate a coin flip. 
To simulate a single shot from an independent shooter with a shooting percentage of 50% we type,
```{r sim-basket}
shot_outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE)
```
To make a valid comparison between Kobe and our simulated independent shooter, we need to align both their shooting percentage and 
the number of attempted shots.

```{r}
# type your code for the Exercise here, and Knit
shot_outcomes <- c("H", "M")
sim_basket <- sample(shot_outcomes, size = 133, replace = TRUE, prob = c(.45, .55))
sim_basket
table(sim_basket)
```

### Comparing Kobe Bryant to the Independent Shooter

```{r sim-streak-lengths}
# type your code for the Exercise here, and Knit
sim_streak <- calc_streak(sim_basket)
```

```{r plot-sim-streaks}
# type your code for the Exercise here, and Knit
ggplot(data = sim_streak, aes(x = length)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1)
```
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________
1.Question 1
Fill in the blank: A streak length of 1 means one ___ followed by one miss.
    Hit

2.Question 2
Fill in the blank: A streak length of 0 means one ___ which must occur after a miss that ended the preceding streak.
    Miss

3.Question 3
Which of the following is false about the distribution of Kobe’s streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals.
    The shortest streak is of length 1.

4.Question 4
If you were to run the simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how would you expect its streak distribution to compare to the distribution from the exercise above?
    Somewhat similar

5.Question 5
How does Kobe Bryant’s distribution of streak lengths compare to the distribution of streak lengths for the simulated shooter? Using this comparison, do you have evidence that the hot hand model fits Kobe’s shooting patterns?
    The distributions look very different. Therefore, there doesn’t appear to be evidence for Kobe Bryant’s hot hand.
